	Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get the script working in my Unity project, and thus I don’t have the screenshots here. I was having a lot of trouble with VSCode. There’s a likely possibility that I’m just coding it wrong, but whenever I open the script, a long series of VSCode loads come up, along with the error message that the “Debugger” (I think the C\# Dev Kit debugger) failed to download as my operating system is too old. I noticed that whenever I try to add a variable—or anything into the start function—it flags an error on the entire script. Unity will then not allow the script to run as it has been flagged as an error. Due to this, the current script I had is empty. I tried multiple for/while loops to do the exponent problem, but due to the errors I couldn’t run them.
